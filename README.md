# sprnz

A collection of tools that use promises

The name is from “esperanza” which is a Spanish word for “hope”.

## Development

### Run tests in watch mode:

```sh
npm run test-watch
```

### Run all tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

### Create a new package:

```sh
npm run create-package <library-name>
```

For example, running the following:

```sh
npm run create-package my-library
```

...will create the library named `@sprnz/my-library` library under `./packages`
